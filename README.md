# Navid A. Mulla  

M.Tech in Robotics (2020) | Robotics Software Engineer | ROS2, MoveIt2, Navigation Stacks  

I specialize in building end-to-end robotics solutions: from CAD models and Gazebo simulations to ROS2 navigation stacks and real robot deployments.  
Currently, I am developing a new Navigation Stack in ROS2. My earlier work in ROS1 (see [Sparky](https://github.com/navidmulla60/sparky)) demonstrates multi-package, modular robotics software design.

## Key Expertise
- ROS2 and MoveIt2: motion planning, dual-arm pick-and-place, Gazebo to real hardware deployment  
- Navigation: custom Navigation Stacks (ROS1 and ROS2), multi-point navigation, localization with RTAB-Map  
- Perception: RealSense camera integration, point cloud processing, YOLO object detection  
- Software: Python, C++, Django, Node.js, REST APIs, FastAPI, AWS (S3, EC2)
